Transportation problems are a subset of Linear Programming Problems (LPPs) in which objects are carried from a set of sources to a set of destinations while considering the supply and demand of the sources and destinations in minimizing the overall cost of transportation.

Types of Transportation problems:
1) Balanced: A balanced transportation situation is one in which both supplies and demands are equal.

2) Umbalanced: A transportation situation is said to be unbalanced when supply and demand are not equal. To make this type of problem balanced, either a dummy row or a dummy column is inserted, depending on the requirement. Then, like with the balanced problem, it can be solved.
